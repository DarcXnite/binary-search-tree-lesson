# Binary Search Tree ðŸŒ´

We are going to be implementing a Binary Tree together! ðŸŽ‰

Since Trees are a data structure that relies on nodes, I like to think of a Binary Tree as a pre-sorted type of linked list. There is a little alorithmic logic to how a BST stores the data.

To get started head over to BinaryTree.py and check out the classes there. There are method stubs that we are going to fill out together!

#### Data structures that rely on nodes

...and a good order to study them in.

1. Linked lists -- introduction to node based datas structures
2. Binary Search Trees -- more complex algorithm for sorting in node based data structure
3. Tries -- tree-like datastructure where one node can be related to an arbitrary amount of nodes
4. Graphs -- any node can be linked to any other node in this data strucutre
